<h1>NASA Near-Miss Meteor App</h1>  
<h2>A Code First Girls Project</h2>  

<h3>Project Brief:</h3>  
Create a console app that interacts with an API of your choice, retrieves data, and performs a meaningful transformation.  
<br />

<h3>Description</h3> 

The **NASA Near-Miss Meteor App** is a Python script that connects to **NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) API** to retrieve information about asteroids that have passed, are passing, or will pass close to Earth.  

By entering a **past, present, or future year**, users can view a detailed list of near-miss asteroids, including:  

- **Asteroid Name**  
- **Date of Close Approach**  
- **Speed (mph)**  
- **Miss Distance (miles)**  

The program **generates a CSV file** containing this data for further analysis.  

For users who want to **learn more about asteroids**, the script includes an **optional feature** that connects to **Spotify's API**. If selected, it retrieves **20 podcast episodes related to asteroids** and randomly suggests **5** for the user to listen to.  

This project is written in **Python** and runs in the **Python terminal**. It demonstrates **API integration, data filtering, file handling (CSV generation), and external data retrieval**.
